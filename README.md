Rotate-90

A 2D terminal platformer in which you must gather all the keys in the level, to unlock the door. 
However, there is a twist - the map for each level rotates at a set interval, and gets subsequently harder, with more frequent rotations and more keys to gather as the levels progress. A timer will track how long it takes you to complete all three levels; try to beat yout best score!

Level 1: Grassy Plains
The first level is a tutorial level where you only need to gather one key. The level rotates every 10 seconds.

Level 2: Volcanic Fracture
The Volcanic Fractures is more challenging, you must gather 3 keys, and overcome the 5 second rotations. 

Level 3: Dark Dungeons
The Dark Dungeons is the final and hardest level. You need to gather 5 keys, dealing with rotations every 3 seconds.
